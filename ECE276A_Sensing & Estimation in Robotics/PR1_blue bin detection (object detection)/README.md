# Blue-bin detector via logistic regression
Develop a blue-bin detector via logistic regression on color classification and morphological properties of detected blue regions.

1. identify blue region (color of recycling bin)

2. image processing (erosion and dilation)

3. use bounding box to do annotation

4. create the mask for detected bin
